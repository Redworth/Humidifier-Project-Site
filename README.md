# About the Project

### The Idea: 
My team and I wanted to make a smart device that can respond to inputs from a smartphone-based application, and one of the first devices that came to our minds was a humidifier, leading us to make our smart humidifier project.

### Core Requirements: 
We wanted our humidifier to do the following: respond to user inputs from the phone, and use on-device intelligence to smartly figure out what to do at what time. One example of this was to be able to schedule the device to turn on at a certain time, or when the temperature drops below a certain amount. We also wanted the user to control the device even when they are far away from the device location, and as well as when the user's phone and the humidifier are connected to different Wi-fi networks. This last one was one requirement we were quite passionate about, and we aimed for achieve this requirement for quite a bit of time.

### What Problem does this Idea Resolve?: 
Most devices that are not connected to the internet are typically involved with manual control of some sort from the user. This meant that whenever a person forgot to turn their device off when they left somewhere, it wasted a lot of energy and bills for electricity increased by quite a bit. Alongside this, many smart devices can only be controlled within the same Wi-Fi network, meaning that even with a smart device the user cannot control their device when they are away from it, once again wasting quite a bit of energy as it keeps using electricity with no reason to do so. This is why we endured on this project, as this project will solve the above problem as the device can be controlled outside of the same network the device is in, meaning that the user can control the device from anywhere in the world, saving a lot of cost and electricity for the user.
